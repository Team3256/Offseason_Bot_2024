### Convention

- Spotless: ./gradlew spotlessApply

### Guides

- Design doc template
- Best practices
  - Git commit message style:
    - [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
    - Optionally, "feat," "chore(docs)," "fix" tags can replaced using [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev)
    - Sometimes, for fun, we theme our commits based on a holiday (if we have a meeting during a holiday). At least [I](https://github.com/ThatXliner) do.
    - Please keep commit messages relevant to the changes made (e.g. no "Friday FRC meeting changes" or "edits I made at midnight")
    - Keep commits atomic: separate them based on small, semantic changes
      - E.g. prefer "Added shooter subsystem," "implemented commands for shooter subsystem," and "Linked up operator controls to shooter" over the non-atomic "implemented everything shooter subsystem" (instead, that should be a separate branch)

### File locations

Category

- Constants are ~~centralized in Constants.java~~ are decentralized per subsystem due to the insane amount of merge conflicts caused by centralizing them
- Helpers are decentralized (per system)
- Shared (across multiple subsystems) helpers go to the drivers folder.
- Simulation is decentralized (per subsystem), Sim 2D visualizer is centralized in RobotSimviz.java
- Commands are decentralized (per subsystem), huge command compositions are centralized in `autos/` folder

Individual

- PathPlanner autos in deploy/pathplanner
- Glass config in simgui.json, simgui-window.json, and simgui-ds.json
